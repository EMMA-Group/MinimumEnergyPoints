# MinimumEnergyPoints
Distribute points on hyperspheres such that user-defined energy is minimized.
MATLAB GUI and command line.

Start the GUI by running `Start_ME_Points.m`.
A command line script template is provided in the subfolder `examples/`.

User-defined kernel functions have to be implemented in
`source/PointPotential.m` and in `source/dPointPotential.m`.
