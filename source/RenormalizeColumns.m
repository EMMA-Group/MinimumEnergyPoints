function [ Y, l ] = RenormalizeColumns( X )
%% RENORMALIZECOLUMNS Returns a copy of X in which the columns are
% normalized.
% 
% Inputs
% X           D x N matrix containing nonzero column vectors;
%             each column will be interpreted in terms of
%             one sampling point
%
% Outputs
% Y           copy of X with normalized columns
% l           vector containing the length of each column of X
