filename scheme:
D   = dimension of Euclidean space, i.e. for points on the d-sphere: D=d+1
N   = number of points
sym = symmetry flag: 1 means symmetrized kernel was used, 0 means usual kernel was used
s   = case index: -2 means LOG, -1 means log, >0 means Riesz

storage format:
.txt: tab and space separated numbers, N-by-D entries
.mat: contains a matrix "X", D-by-N entries, and a struct with the initial parameters

example:
D6_N512_sym0_s-2.txt
D6_N512_sym0_s-2.mat
